Formatting Checklist: (Mainly for LaTeX)
- [ ] References
  - [ ] Remove the ''The'' in front of journal titles.
  - [ ] Journals title capitalisation
  - [ ] Author names with special characters
  - [ ] Page/Volume numbers or Forthcoming?
  - [ ] Comma after punctuation
  - [ ] Capitalisation of proper nouns
  - [ ] Capitalisation of acronyms
  - [ ] All referenced must be cited at least once within the text. All citations must be included in the reference.
- [ ] Text/English
  - [ ] Acronyms must be defined before use. After they are defined, they must be used.
  - [ ] Oxford comma -- optional but needs to be consistent.
  - [ ] Footnotes should not be placed before punctuation. They must come after.
  - [ ] Check spacing before/after footnotes and other punctuation/symbols.
  - [ ] No contractions.
  - [ ] Avoid ampersands (&) 
  - [ ] (Optional) no personal pronouns.
  - [ ] Variables/maths in text should be written in math mode.
  - [ ] Dates should be written out consistently. Usually as D MMM YYYY, although MMM D, YYYY is also acceptable... (for the Americans)
  - [ ] Try not to let some texts be broken onto a new line e.g. ''New Zealand'' can be written as ''New~Zealand'' to ensure that the 'New' and 'Zealand' are on the same line. (Ctrl + Shift + Space for MSWord)
  - [ ] Check quotation marks: ` vs '.
  - [ ] Avoid spamming Enter to start a new page. LaTeX: \pagebreak. MSWord: Ctrl + Enter.
  - [ ] Have consistent fonts and font sizes.
  - [ ] In MSWord use the spell checker: F7.
- [ ] Math
  - [ ] Equations/formulas should be connected to the text and have appropriate punctuation.
  - [ ] Brackets/Parentheses/Braces should be correctly sized (using ''\left'' and ''\right'' -- for LaTeX)
  - [ ] Negative numbers should be written in math mode. See the differences between en dash, em dash, hyphen, and minus sign.
  - [ ] Superscripts/subscripts should be written in braces {} to ensure that things are in the correct location.
  - [ ] max, min, log, ln, exp, sin, and cos etc etc. should be written with a backslash e.g. \max -- for LaTeX.
- [ ] Tables/Figures
  - [ ] Captions titles should be above tables and below figures. Caption details for tables can be placed below the table.
  - [ ] Figures titles within the figure should be removed -- they should be placed as the caption title.
  - [ ] If tables and figures are placed at the end, include an ''Insert Figure/Table ## about here.'' centred in the page where the table/figure should be placed.
  - [ ] Tables/Figures should be referred to at least once within the text and ideally close to where the table/figure is placed.
  - [ ] Asterisks used for levels of significance should be superscripted.
  - [ ] Acronyms used should be redefined in the caption.
  - [ ] In general, tables and figures should be centered.
  - [ ] If possible, figures should be vector graphics -- usually saved as a .pdf, .eps, .svg. (.svg usually works well with MSWord.)
  

Most things are subjective and can be argued against -- please make sure you don't argue against yourself by being inconsistent.
There is always a lot of background work that goes into writing a paper. The only thing readers see is what we present to them. If what they see is inconsistent and not correct that is a bad signal for them when they look at your work.
